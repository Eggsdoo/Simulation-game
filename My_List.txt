This is what I have done for the project:

1.  I have created a polymorphic special ability based on the warrior's class. (7 points)
    These abilities are the following: 
        1. Human - healing ability
        2. Elf - dexterity bonus buff
        3. Orc - strength bonus buff


2.  Provide a way for the player to play again (without restarting the program from the beginning) (3 points)
    saving the game, and playing again with a reset().
        The player is able to save and restart the game at the end of the game.


3.  Giving the player the ability to surrender. (1 point)
        The player is able to surrender if their health falls below 100.

    
4.  Track the number of turns, the total damage done and print these stats after the match (when game ends). (1 point)
        Prints all of this information at the end of the game.


5. Prompt the user for a name for their warrior and randomly assign a name to the enemy - must be used during the match (as in print outs)
you can create a names class for the enemy. (2 points)
        Will prompt the user to name themselves at the beginning of the game and will generate enemy name.


6. Add some color to the output in the terminal. (1 point)
        Added a little bit of colour to make important parts easily noticeable.
